# Evolutation Prisoners Dilemma
An evolutaionary approach to an iterated prisoner's dilemma game. 

# The Game
Every player will write the strategy of a prisoner for a prisoner's dilemma game. 

# Evolution
For every round, each player's prisoner will be spawned 100 times in the arena to start. All programs will be randomly paired against one another, and play Prisoner's Dilemma 100 times. For each prisoner program, a total payoff for each of the 100 games played is tabulated, and the total number of points scored by every prisoner is totaled. The percentage of total points that each prisoner's program recieves will determine it's representation in the next round.  

For example, if two programs are spawned in an arena (100 copies each), and Prisoner1 scores a total of 750 points, and Prisoner2 scores only 250 points, the in the next round, Prisoner1 make up 75% of the spawned programs in the next round.
